# DesmatamentoXMultas

The idea for this visualization came after I saw the following news"https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/multas-do-ibama-cairam-42-enquanto-desmatamento-aumentou-95-24775977". It shows how the number of fines have decreasead while the deforestation in the Amazon forest has decreased, one thought that crossed my mind was how that didn't necessarely meant that people burning the forest weren't getting fined, it could be that we are getting small number fires but that burn a greater area, os a better data to look at would be to what sum those fines would amount. 

While in 2019 the decrease in number of fines (with the increase of deforestation) did not decrease the sum of the fines amount, the same is not true for the year 2020 when we saw a significant decrease in both fines numbes and amount while the deforestation increasead.
